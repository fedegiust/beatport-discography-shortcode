Beatport Discography Shortcode
==============================

Wordpress plugin that adds a shortcode on posts or pages to read the artist discography using the Beatport API. 
This plugin gets the feed on request and on the fly, so there is no need to save in database or do any updates.
As soon as a release is out on beatport it will be on the list.

It's very easy to use:

1 - Install the plugin
2 - Activate
3 - Create a new post or page
4 - Click the icon with the green Beatport logo on the toolbar
5 - Type in your artist name, or the artist name you want to show the discography on your wordpress site.

Done.
